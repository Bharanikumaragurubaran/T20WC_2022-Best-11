# T20WC_2022-Best-11
Here we have collected entire 2022 T20 World cup data to finalise best 11 players who can win any team in a T20 match.
## Setup
Here I have used Power BI to build dashboards which will showcase every players performance throughout the 2022 Worldcup, based on their performance we would have finalised Best 11 players. 
You can view these dashboards by downloading "t20wc_best 11.pbix" file and opening it in Power BI app.
## Process involved in finalising best 11 players
  1. Web scraping:
        I used Python Webscraping to scrape Match results, Batting statistics, Bowling Statsitics and Player info from Espncricinfo website and saved them as JSON           files.
  2. Python Pandas:
        I used Pandas to perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the JSON files that we got from above steps and saved them as CSV files.
  3. Power BI:
        Power BI is used to build dashboards using preprocessed CSV files to showcase players performance and finalise Best 11 players that played 2022 T20 World             Cup.
